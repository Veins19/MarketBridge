# MarketBridge – AI-Driven Marketing Campaign Planner

**MarketBridge** is an intelligent multi-agent platform that automates marketing campaign planning by connecting marketing, finance, and inventory teams through autonomous AI agents.

The system uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to access CRM, finance, and inventory data in real time, allowing businesses to plan, optimize, and adapt campaigns more efficiently.

---

## Overview

Marketing campaign planning typically requires coordination between multiple departments:

* **Marketing:** Responsible for creative ideas and targeting customer segments.
* **Finance:** Ensures financial feasibility, budget control, and ROI.
* **Inventory:** Confirms product availability and supply chain readiness.

**MarketBridge** simplifies this process by using AI agents that collaborate and negotiate automatically to produce data-driven campaign plans.

## Agent Workflow

1. The **Creative Agent** proposes marketing ideas, content, and segments.
2. The **Finance Agent** validates these plans based on budget and ROI.
3. The **Inventory Agent** checks stock levels and supply constraints.
4. Agents collaborate and negotiate to finalize a feasible, optimized campaign plan.
5. The resulting plan is displayed to the user along with supporting data and visualizations.
